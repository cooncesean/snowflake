# Feedback
Some feedback on the tool as I (sean) used it on my team. I'd love to see if you guys shared any similar sentiments.

## Characteristics & Leveling
1. "Cultural Beacon" needs to be filled in.
1. "Technical Design & Writing" seems geared too low. Level 2 seems like Level 1.
1. "Initiative" leveling also seems geared too low ... you almost get to level 2 via the act of shipping stuff to production.
1. The wording is odd for "Initiative - Level 3": "Causes change to positively impact an entire team or _instigates a minor feature or service_".

## People
1. Otto scored a little lower than expected. But he's a wonderfully talented engineer, so this does not compute. Maybe it's the distance and ability to impact the org from afar, or maybe we're missing a category.
1. Tyler also skews low because his biggest experience lies with the SDK; which technically isn't a part of the back-end nor front-end.
1. Danny Diekroeger also scored low. Part of this is b/c he is pretty junior, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something here or just haven't seen enough consistency from him to score him higher in certain areas.
